Display mathematical expressions using dynamically generated images.

== Description ==

The Axiom plugin relies on the GD library for PHP to generate images.  The fonts used by the included phpMathPlublisher library are included.
There is an error in the plugin url. Information on the plugin can be found at http://randy.rlmdev.com/axiom/
There is a help file for syntax located in ~/axiom/doc/index.html
There is a major problem. I can not get the proper sub-directories to load up via subversion. Please be patient as I try to fight my way through this.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the directory `axiom` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Make /axiom/img readable and writable by the web server
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
